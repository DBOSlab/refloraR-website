## Overview

`refloraR` is an R package for exploring plant specimen collections from the [REFLORA Virtual Herbarium](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/reflora), hosted by the [Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden](https://www.gov.br/jbrj). The package interacts with the REFLORA Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) by readily downloading full specimen records in Darwin Core Format. It also provides functions to summarize and filter data by taxonomic or geographical criteria.

## The REFLORA Programme

Brazil holds the richest plant diversity in the world ([BFG 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/tax.12640)). Historically, many plant specimens were sent to European herbaria during the 18th–19th centuries. These collections formed the basis for many species descriptions and the monumental *Flora brasiliensis* ([Martius, Eichler & Urban, 1840–1906](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/454)).

Launched in 2010, the REFLORA/CNPq Programme aimed to digitize and repatriate information on Brazilian plant specimens stored abroad. In 2014, the programme expanded in partnership with SiBBr and IFN. The data are published via the [REFLORA Virtual Herbarium](https://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/herbarioVirtual/ConsultaPublicoHVUC/ConsultaPublicoHVUC.do).

Developed by the [JBRJ](https://www.gov.br/jbrj) and [COPPE/UFRJ](https://coppe.ufrj.br/en/home-en/), the platform supports taxonomic validation and collaboration via the [Flora e Funga do Brasil](https://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/consulta/) initiative.

## The REFLORA Virtual Herbarium

The Reflora Virtual Herbarium was commissioned by CNPq to JBRJ in 2010 to provide centralized, high-resolution, publicly accessible data on Brazilian specimens. It replicates key functions of physical herbarium curation. Curators can re-determine and typify specimens, while taxonomists contribute to species validation. Over 900 taxonomists have contributed to the platform.

Early partners included herbaria [**K**](https://www.kew.org), [**P**](https://www.mnhn.fr/fr/collection-des-plantes-vasculaires), and [**RB**](https://www.gov.br/jbrj), with later support from [**SiBBr**](https://www.sibbr.gov.br) and [**IFN**](https://www.gov.br/florestal/pt-br/assuntos/ifn). The initiative continues to digitize Brazilian and international collections.
